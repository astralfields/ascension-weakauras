# ascension-weakauras

This is a collection of my personal weakauras for Project Ascension.

Please note that I use ElvUI and try to make most of my auras fit visually into my setup. This means that my bar textures will usually be ElvUI Blank and the font will be Expressway.
If you don't have these available, what you import will look slightly different.

# Powerbars

Simple mana, energy, and rage bars with a bonus mainhand swing timer.

# Harbinger

Aura set for the Harbinger of Pestilence legendary RE, using the epic REs: Coax to Darkness, Wrath of the Plague, Dusk till Dawn.

The three icons are (left to right): Stack tracker and timer for the Harbinger of Pestilence buff, CD tracker for Shadowburn, stack tracker and timer for the Dusk till Dawn buff.
I didn't bother adding another icon for Coax to Darkness since it stacks in tandem with the Harbinger buff.

The top bar tracks the cooldown of Haunt. The other three are timers for Insect Swarm: Plague, Devouring Plague, and Corruption on your current target. If you don't have a specific DoT on your target, there will be a reminder (you can just delete every aura with "Reminder" in its name if you don't want these).

This should also work for the more single-target focused Spirit build which uses the Clear Mind RE instead of Coax to Darkness. If you're not using CtD, the icon and timer bar should simply not show up.

**NEW:** Per a user's request, I have added a version of this aura set which also contains bars and reminders for Unstable Affliction and Shadow Word: Pain. You can find it in the file "Harbinger-UA". Please note that I have not tested this as I don't have these spells available.
