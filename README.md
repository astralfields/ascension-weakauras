# ascension-weakauras

This is a collection of my personal weakauras for Project Ascension.

Please note that I use ElvUI and try to make most of my auras fit visually into ElvUI. This means that my bar textures will usually be ElvUI Blank and the font will be Expressway.
If you don't have these available, what you import will look slightly different.

# Powerbars

Simple mana, energy, and rage bars with a bonus mainhand swing timer.
